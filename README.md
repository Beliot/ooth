# OOTH - a user identity management system

Introducing medium article: [Ooth - user accounts for node.js](https://medium.com/the-ideal-system/ooth-user-accounts-for-node-js-93cfcd28ed1a#.97kyfg4xg).

NOTE: Until version 1.0.0 is reached, the API will be unstable and can't be considered safe for production.
